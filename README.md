# Webpack 4 React

Another React boilerplate with the latest `webpack` v4 ecosystem.

New libraries used including:

- `webpack-command`
- `webpack-serve`
- `mini-css-extract-plugin`
- `optimize-css-assets-webpack-plugin`

## Get Started

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/bodaz/webpack-4-react.git
$ cd webpack-4-react/
$ yarn

# to start development server
$ yarn run serve

# to build
$ yarn run build
```

React app is live at http://localhost:8080/

## What's changed in the Webpack ecosystem?

**Webpack CLI**

Use `webpack-command` instead of `webpack-cli`

**Developement Server**

Use `webpack-command` instead of `webpack-dev-server`

**Build/Minify SCSS Files**

Use `mini-css-extract-plugin` and `optimize-css-assets-webpack-plugin` instead of `extract-text-webpack-plugin`
